## 1. Research Identity

**Applied AI • Scientific Machine Learning • Human–AI Interaction • Computational Systems Engineering**

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Scientific ML and simulation-informed modeling  
- Explainable and trustworthy decision systems  
- Human-centered reasoning workflows  
- Real-time fraud, anomaly, and credit intelligence systems  
- Cloud-native, scalable, research-grade AI architecture  

I focus on transparent systems, numerical reliability, reproducible workflows, and decision governance.

## 4. Evidence, Reproducibility & Documentation

This repository includes:

- **Deep-dive case studies** (problem, methodology, experiments, limitations, future work)  
- **Architecture diagrams** (Aegis, CredScore, Fraud Engine, SmartCare)  
- **Human–AI Interaction diagram suite** (cognitive loops, trust calibration, transparency flows)  
- **Reproducibility artifacts**: configs, sample transcripts, datasets, environment, and evaluation runbooks  
- **Machine-readable metadata** (`selected-works.json`, `supporting-works.json`, `publications.json`)  
- **Technical projects** showing engineering execution depth  

These artifacts are prepared for academic evaluation and research verification.
