This repository contains my **applied AI**, **credit and fraud analytics**,  
**healthcare analytics**, **SaaS security engineering**, and **cloud modernization** work.  
It includes selected works, whitepapers, talks, patents, technical projects,  
and machine-readable metadata prepared for academic and industry evaluation.

> **Why this matters:** this repository is meant to help reviewers see not just tools and buzzwords, but the real systems, decisions, and responsibilities I have handled.

# Project Deep-Dive Case Studies

These deep dives present full, research-oriented analyses of my most impactful applied AI and engineering systems.  
Each document includes the problem statement, architecture, methodology, evaluation metrics, reproducibility notes,  
ethical considerations, and future research directions.

### **1. Aegis — NLP-Driven Video Intelligence Platform**  
→ [`aegis-deep-dive.md`](./docs/deep-dives/aegis-deep-dive.md)

### **2. CredScore — Explainable Credit Scoring System**  
→ [`credscore-deep-dive.md`](./docs/deep-dives/credscore-deep-dive.md)

### **3. Real-Time Fraud Detection Engine**  
→ [`fraud-engine-deep-dive.md`](./docs/deep-dives/fraud-engine-deep-dive.md)

### **4. SmartCare — Eldercare Decision-Support Platform**  
→ [`smartcare-deep-dive.md`](./docs/deep-dives/smartcare-deep-dive.md)

These case studies provide **evidence of engineering depth, research maturity,  
cross-domain problem solving, and human-centered design** across my 23-year career.

# Research Methodology

My full research philosophy, methods, evaluation principles, and reproducibility framework are available here:

➡️ **Research Methodology & Design Philosophy**  
[`/docs/research-methodology.md`](./docs/research-methodology.md)

This document explains:
- How I design and validate AI systems  
- How I handle uncertainty, fairness, ethics, and governance  
- My scientific workflow from prototype → evaluation → deployment  
- My reproducibility and transparency approach  
- Links to methodology diagrams (loops, pipelines, reproducibility cycles)

It provides reviewers with a clear understanding of *how I think and work as a researcher*.
