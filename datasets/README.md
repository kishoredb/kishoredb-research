# Datasets (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for curated, non-sensitive sample datasets used in the deep-dive evaluations and reproducibility workflows.

Full production datasets are not included due to confidentiality constraints.

Included here will be:
- Sample schemas
- Synthetic example records
- Small anonymized dataset excerpts
- Format documentation

For now, please refer to `/docs/reproducibility/datasets/` for active sample files.
