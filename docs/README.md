# Documentation Overview

This folder contains extended technical and research-oriented documentation
that supports the main portfolio. These documents provide deeper insight into
the engineering decisions, architectural reasoning, reproducibility details,
and research motivations behind my major projects.

The goal of this section is to make the portfolio useful for:
- academic reviewers
- PhD committees
- industry R&D evaluators
- collaborators and research partners

---

## 📘 Deep-Dive Project Documents
Detailed case studies of major projects, including:
- problem definition
- system architecture
- technical approach
- evaluation & metrics
- reproducibility notes
- ethical considerations
- limitations and future work

Deep-dive documents will be available in:
/docs/deep-dives/


---

## 🔬 Reproducibility Notes (Optional)
Guides, synthetic dataset descriptions, environment configuration, and
replication steps for selected projects.

These materials will be available in:
/docs/reproducibility/


---

## Purpose of This Section
While the main repository pages summarise my work, the `/docs/` folder provides
the deeper, research-focused material that committees often expect when
reviewing technical contributions. It complements:

- `selected-works.md`
- `technical-projects.md`
- `publications.md`
- `research-statement.md`

by offering structured, transparent, and academically aligned documentation.

If you have any questions or would like additional documentation,
please feel free to reach out.
