# Documentation Overview

This folder contains extended technical and research-oriented documentation
that supports the main portfolio. These documents provide deeper insight into
the engineering decisions, architectural reasoning, reproducibility details,
and research motivations behind my major projects.

The goal of this section is to make the portfolio useful for:
- academic reviewers
- PhD committees
- industry R&D evaluators
- collaborators and research partners

---

## 📘 Deep-Dive Project Documents
Detailed case studies of major projects, including:
- problem definition
- system architecture
- technical approach
- evaluation & metrics
- reproducibility notes
- ethical considerations
- limitations and future work

Deep-dive documents will be available in:
/docs/deep-dives/

# Research Methodology & Design Philosophy

A full explanation of my research approach, scientific workflow, evaluation principles, and reproducibility practices is available here:

➡️ **Research Methodology (Full Document)**  
[`/docs/research-methodology.md`](./research-methodology.md)

This document details:

- My philosophy for designing trustworthy, human-centered AI  
- My evaluation workflows (quantitative + qualitative)  
- My reproducibility approach for ML and data systems  
- My transparency pipeline and explainability principles  
- Methodology diagrams (loops, pipelines, reproducibility cycle)  
- How my industry experience informs my academic direction  

It provides reviewers with a clear map of *how I think, reason, and conduct research* across AI, risk analytics, and socio-technical systems.

## 🔬 Reproducibility Notes (Optional)
Guides, synthetic dataset descriptions, environment configuration, and
replication steps for selected projects.

These materials will be available in:
/docs/reproducibility/

## Purpose of This Section
While the main repository pages summarise my work, the `/docs/` folder provides
the deeper, research-focused material that committees often expect when
reviewing technical contributions. It complements:

- `selected-works.md`
- `technical-projects.md`
- `publications.md`
- `research-statement.md`

by offering structured, transparent, and academically aligned documentation.
