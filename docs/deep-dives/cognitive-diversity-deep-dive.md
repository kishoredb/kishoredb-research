# 🌍 Deep Dive: Cognitive Diversity in AI-Supported Decision Work  
**Author:** Kishore D. B.  
**Updated:** 2025-12-08  
Location: `docs/deep-dives/cognitive-diversity-deep-dive.md`

This deep dive documents conceptual and empirical work exploring how different
cognitive profiles (fast vs reflective, rule-first vs intuition-first,
detail-focused vs pattern-focused) interact with AI systems in complex decision
flows.

# 1. Problem Statement

Organizations often treat “users” as a single group.  
But cognitive diversity dramatically affects:

- trust in AI  
- interpretation of explanations  
- susceptibility to automation bias  
- override behaviour  
- error detection ability  

The study investigated:

**How do diverse cognitive profiles shape human–AI collaboration?**

---

# 2. Research Questions

1. Do different cognitive profiles rely on AI differently?  
2. How does mental-model variation impact explanation comprehension?  
3. Which groups benefit most from transparency cues?  
4. Which groups are most at risk of over-reliance or under-reliance?  

---

# 3. Study Design

### Methods (pre-2023 execution)
- Short cognitive-style inventories  
- Task simulations with AI assistance  
- Qualitative interviews exploring reasoning patterns  
- Explanation comprehension tests  

### Variables examined:
- speed-based vs accuracy-based decision makers  
- rule-driven vs intuition-driven approaches  
- varying tolerance for ambiguity  

---

# 4. Findings (Observed + Conceptual)

- Fast pattern matchers rely more on AI but are also more override-prone.  
- Reflective thinkers preferred uncertainty-aware explanations.  
- Rule-driven users trusted deterministic rules more than probabilistic SHAP.  
- For diversity improved group accuracy, complementary strengths reduced blind spots.  

---

# 5. Links to Repository Systems

- **Credit workflows:** cognitive differences directly influence lending decisions.  
- **Fraud review:** high-ambiguity tasks strongly interact with cognitive style.  
- **Aegis:** retrieval interpretation varies based on user mental models.
