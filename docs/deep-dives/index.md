# **Project Deep-Dive Case Studies**
### Detailed Architecture • Methods • Evaluation • Ethics • Future Work

These deep-dive documents present the full, research-oriented analysis behind my most
impactful applied AI and engineering systems.  
They expand the summaries found in **Selected Works** and **Technical Projects** into
complete narratives that explain:

- the real-world problem and constraints  
- architecture and design decisions  
- algorithms, models, and workflows  
- evaluation approaches and metrics  
- reproducibility considerations  
- ethical reflections and human impact  
- limitations and future directions  

They are written for academic reviewers, PhD committees, industry R&D teams,
and anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the systems I have built over 23 years.

## **How to Use This Section**

If you are a reviewer, start with:

1. **CredScore** — to understand my approach to explainability and regulated ML  
2. **Fraud Detection Engine** — to see hybrid ML + rule systems  
3. **Aegis** — for NLP pipelines and large-scale content intelligence  
4. **SmartCare** — to understand my early foundation in decision support  

These documents serve as **evidence of research maturity**,  
**engineering depth**, and **human-centered system design**.
