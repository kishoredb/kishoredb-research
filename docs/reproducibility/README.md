# 🔬 Reproducibility Notes  
**Purpose:**  
This section provides lightweight, research-oriented reproducibility materials for selected projects.  
These notes help reviewers understand how experiments were validated, how results can be repeated,  
and how to interpret sample datasets, configurations, and execution steps.

These materials do **not** include any confidential customer data or internal systems.  
All datasets here are synthetic, minimal, and safe for academic/portfolio use.

## 🧭 How To Use This Section  
This reproducibility folder is designed for academic review, not production execution.  
It provides:

- Example synthetic datasets  
- Conceptual experiment steps  
- Reproducibility techniques  
- Reference configs and environment notes  

It strengthens the *research credibility* of the portfolio without exposing sensitive data.
