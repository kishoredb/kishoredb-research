# SmartCare — Evaluation Steps (Synthetic Demo)

SmartCare predates modern ML stacks, so evaluation focuses on rule reasoning,
pattern detection, and alert usefulness.

## 1. Synthetic Elder-Care Dataset

| patient_id | symptoms | vitals | mobility | outcome |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 001        | fever    | mild   | stable   | escalate |
| 002        | dizziness | normal | stable | monitor  |

## 2. Rule Engine Validation

Check:

- rule firing accuracy  
- overlap between rules  
- contradictory rules  

---

## 3. Early Warning Signal Checks

Synthetic timelines are used to test:

- symptom progression detection  
- threshold triggers  
- false alarm reduction  

---

## 4. Caregiver Feedback Simulation

Conceptual evaluation of:

- clarity of alerts  
- timeliness  
- confidence indicators
