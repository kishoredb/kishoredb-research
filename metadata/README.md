# Metadata (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for extended machine-readable metadata to support indexing, automated evaluation, and reproducibility tooling.

Planned contents:
- Cross-reference tables for selected works
- Dataset documentation
- System-level provenance metadata
- Optional JSON schema for research ingestion

At present, core metadata is stored in the root (`selected-works.json`, `supporting-works.json`, `publications.json`).
