## 1. Automated Vulnerability Classification & Prioritization  
**Disclosure ID:** SEC-2023-41  
**Year:** 2023  
**Status:** Internal Technical Disclosure  
**Domain:** Security automation, ML classification, SaaS platforms  

An ML-assisted framework for security vulnerability triage in multi-tenant  
cloud systems. The approach integrates static/dynamic signals, model-based  
risk scoring, and rule-engine overrides to prioritize vulnerabilities across  
large distributed infrastructures.

## 2. Explainable AI Framework for Simulation-Based Decision Systems  
**Year:** 2023  
**Status:** Concept Disclosure (Internal)  
**Domain:** XAI, scientific ML, simulation workflows  

Describes a method to generate structured explanations for simulation-driven  
ML models, combining gradient analysis, SHAP summaries, and sensitivity  
indices. Intended to support regulated decision environments (risk modelling,  
clinical analytics, operational forecasting).

## 3. AI-Driven Document Intelligence Normalization Pipeline  
**Year:** 2022  
**Status:** Draft Disclosure (Internal)  
**Domain:** NLP, document intelligence, financial analytics  

Draft disclosure covering a normalized architecture for financial document  
extraction using rule-enhanced NLP, ONNX-based inference, and consistency  
checks. Designed for explainable document insights across retail and corporate  
lending workflows.

## 4. Distributed Simulation Job Orchestration Framework  
**Year:** 2024  
**Status:** Internal Research Disclosure  
**Domain:** HPC orchestration, Kubernetes, scientific computing  

Proposes an efficient orchestration framework for large-scale simulation tasks  
using AKS and Kubernetes-native autoscaling. Includes experiment lineage,  
metadata capture, and deterministic replay support.

---

## Summary  
These entries represent structured innovation work around explainable ML,  
simulation intelligence, document analytics, and secure cloud-native systems.  
Some disclosures remain internal, while others may be adapted for future  
formal IP filings depending on organizational needs.
