# 📚 Publications & Research Outputs  
**Author:** Kishore D. B.  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-01  

This page lists my current research outputs and technical writings across  
**scientific machine learning, computational systems, and AI platforms**.  
Where work is internal or pre-publication, I mark it clearly as such.

## 1. Research Manuscripts & In-Preparation Work

These are research-focused works intended for eventual submission to journals  
or conferences. Status is indicated explicitly.

### 1.1 AI-Enhanced Inverse Modeling Framework *(in preparation)*  
**Type:** Research manuscript (pre-submission)  
**Area:** Scientific ML, inverse problems, optimization  

Explores an explainable AI method for parameter inversion in physics-based  
simulation models, integrating uncertainty quantification and interpretable  
latent parameter spaces. Currently being refined for potential submission to  
a computational science / applied ML venue.

## 2. Technical Whitepapers & Internal Research Reports

These are substantial technical documents and internal whitepapers capturing  
methods, architectures, and experimental findings. They reflect real work but  
are not peer-reviewed publications.

### 2.1 Aegis — AI-Driven Innovation & Simulation Framework  
**Year:** 2023  
**Type:** Internal research whitepaper / framework design report  

Describes the Aegis framework for integrating simulation data, explainable ML,  
and distributed HPC workflows. Focuses on reproducible experiment pipelines,  
semantic indexing of runs, and support for parameter sweeps and model comparison.

### 2.2 CredScore — Explainable Credit Risk Modeling  
**Year:** 2022  
**Type:** Technical report / competition submission  
**Recognition:** Finastra AI Innovation Challenge 2022 — Awarded entry  

Documents an interpretable credit scoring engine combining tree-based models,  
SHAP- and LIME-based explanations, and rule-based governance. Emphasizes model  
transparency for credit adjudication and regulatory review.

### 2.3 AI-Driven Fraud Detection Engine  
**Years:** 2021–2023  
**Type:** Internal technical report  
**Domain:** Anomaly detection, time-series modeling, NLP  

Describes a hybrid pipeline combining time-series anomaly detection and  
transactional NLP for real-time fraud monitoring across financial workloads.

---

### 2.4 Cloud HPC Workflow Simulator  
**Year:** 2024  
**Type:** Prototype design report  
**Domain:** HPC orchestration, AKS, scientific workflows  

Outlines an AI-assisted orchestration layer for distributed simulation  
experiments using Azure Kubernetes Service and Python-based workflow engines.

## 4. Educational & Pedagogical Material

### 4.1 Explainable AI & Scientific Visualization Curriculum  
**Years:** 2020–2023  
**Type:** Educational design work / internal curriculum  

A set of modules linking explainable ML, simulation visualization, and  
computational reasoning for students and practitioners using open-source tools.

---

### 4.2 Learning Analytics for Computational Thinking  
**Year:** 2024  
**Type:** Conceptual framework / research plan  

Outlines a framework for capturing and analyzing student behavior during  
simulation-based tasks using learning analytics and adaptive feedback models.

## 5. Notes on Status & Availability

- Some documents are **internal or anonymized** and cannot be shared in full.  
- Where possible, I provide architecture diagrams, summaries, or redacted PDFs  
  in the repository’s `docs/` or `whitepapers/` folders.  
- All entries here are honest representations of real work; this list is not  
  meant to overstate peer-reviewed publication count but to document  
  **substantive research and engineering output**.
