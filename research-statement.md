# ❤️ RESEARCH STATEMENT

---

## Where My Journey Began
My career did not begin with a research plan. It began with a moment that I have carried for more than 20 years.
In the early 2000s, I was working on a small healthcare analytics tool when a nurse told me,
“Good that this alert came today. I might have missed it.”
That simple sentence showed me what technology can do at its best. It can give someone clarity and confidence in a difficult moment. From that day onward through healthcare, finance, fraud detection, cloud security, and AI systems I carried the same internal question:
“Is this helping someone make a clearer, safer, kinder decision?”
This human-centered lens shaped my entire 23-year journey.

## Why Research Feels Like the Right Next Chapter
Even as I moved into senior roles like Director of Engineering, platform architect, mentor my curiosity always stayed stronger than my job title. I stayed hands-on because I loved learning whether it was late-night prototypes, hackathon experiments, new models, messy data, unexpected insights.
Cross-cultural collaboration shaped me just as much. Working with European research groups on data ethics and responsible AI showed me how people from different backgrounds approach the same question with different perspectives. Those conversations made me feel at home in research environments.
A PhD is not a pause for me.
It is a continuation of lifelong learning. A chance to slow down, reflect deeply, and turn lived experience into structured knowledge for regulators, researchers, and society.

# Questions That Drive My Research

## 1. Why should anyone trust an AI system?
After building credit-scoring and fraud engines that affect real lives, I learned that trust never comes from accuracy alone. It comes from clarity and humility in a system’s behaviour.
I want to study trustworthiness through human-understandable explanations, uncertainty-aware outputs, and transparent decision paths, contributing to ongoing discussions in explainable and trustworthy AI.

---

## 2. How do we keep AI systems reliable when real life is messy?
Data breaks, rules change, behaviour shifts, and unexpected events disrupt models. Reliability is not perfection. It is resilience under pressure.
I aim to explore reproducible ML workflows, adaptive scoring models, and fault-aware system design, building on work in robust ML and dependable data systems.

---

## 3. Why do so many promising research ideas never reach real people?
I’ve seen brilliant prototypes fade because they could not withstand real-world constraints. That gap between research insight and operational reality is one of the most important challenges of applied AI.
I want to investigate lightweight validation methods, practical experiment design, and translational ML practices that help prototypes survive beyond the lab and reach people who need them.

---

## 4. How can technology respect human dignity?
Working within GDPR, PSD2, and emerging AI governance frameworks taught me that ethics is not theory. It is everyday engineering behaviour. Dignity shows up in design decisions, in defaults, in how systems communicate uncertainty.
I hope to explore value-sensitive engineering, inclusive design practices, and simple governance approaches that make it easier for everyday teams to build technology that respects human lives.

# What I Bring Into a Research Environment

### Real-world grounding
I have worked on systems serving 1,400+ institutions, where mistakes have emotional and financial consequences. This keeps my thinking practical and people-focused.

### Cross-domain and cross-cultural fluency
I have moved across healthcare, finance, BSFI, cloud engineering, fraud analytics, and AI across India, Europe, and North America. These experiences help me connect ideas that usually stay in separate rooms.

### Mentoring and leadership
My 12-year involvement in Women-in-Tech mentoring taught me to listen deeply, support others, and build inclusive learning spaces. A skill I hope to bring into research groups.

### A mindset shaped by steady, patient learning
Nothing came quickly. Everything came through persistence, curiosity, and reflection. Research feels like the natural form of that mindset.

# Where I Hope My Work Will Lead
I want my research to:
• help people understand decisions that affect their lives  
• build trust through clarity and explainability  
• reduce the friction between research and real-world systems  
• support regulators and communities who need guidance  
• strengthen human-centered design in AI  

Ultimately, I hope to contribute work that remains useful even as technologies evolve. The ideas that help create a safer and more transparent technological world.

# Conclusion
Just as that nurse once found reassurance in a simple alert, I want my research to give people clarity and trust in the systems they depend on.
I am ready to begin this journey on 1 January 2026, carrying with me every story, lesson, and moment that shaped me. It is not merely as an engineer, but as a human being who believes technology should serve people with dignity and care.
