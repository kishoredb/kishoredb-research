# 🔧 Supporting Works  
**Author:** Kishore D. B.  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Updated:** 2025-12-01  

Supporting Works include mid-level research contributions, prototypes,  
experimentation notes, engineering frameworks, and internal technical analyses  
that complement the flagship items listed in `selected-works.md`.

These entries demonstrate continuity in scientific ML, computational workflows,  
and platform engineering across several years.

## 1. Simulation Data Processing Toolkit  
**Years:** 2023–2024  
**Type:** Experimentation Toolkit / Python Utilities  
**Domain:** Scientific ML, simulation preprocessing  

A set of Python utilities built for preparing simulation datasets for downstream  
ML pipelines — including mesh/geometry feature extraction, normalization  
routines, run metadata capture, and automated dataset versioning.

## 2. Model Explainability Dashboard  
**Year:** 2023  
**Type:** Internal prototype (UI + backend APIs)  
**Domain:** Explainable ML  

A lightweight dashboard for aggregating SHAP values, sensitivity indices, and  
gradient-based interpretability metrics across models used in financial and  
scientific workloads. Includes reproducible experiment exports.

## 3. Cloud-Native Batch Orchestration Templates  
**Years:** 2022–2023  
**Type:** Infrastructure-as-Code Templates  
**Domain:** HPC on Kubernetes  

Reusable IaC templates for orchestrating batch simulation workloads and ML  
experiments on AKS using KEDA, Argo Workflows, and containerized solvers.

---

## 4. Time-Series Feature Engineering Library  
**Year:** 2021  
**Type:** Internal Python library  
**Domain:** Forecasting, anomaly detection  

Implements automated lag feature generation, seasonal decomposition,  
frequency-domain transforms, and rule-based anomaly prefilters used in  
financial time-series workloads.

---

## 5. EHR Data Normalization Pipeline  
**Years:** 2020–2021  
**Type:** Data engineering prototype  
**Domain:** Healthcare ML  

A rules-based and statistical normalization pipeline for converting  
heterogeneous medical datasets into a consistent, ML-ready structure for  
clinical risk modeling.

---

## 6. Parameter Sweep Experiment Scripts  
**Years:** 2020–Present  
**Type:** Experiment automation toolkit  
**Domain:** Numerical optimization / simulation studies  

Shell/Python scripts for running large-scale parameter sweeps across simulation  
models (grid search, random sweep, Latin hypercube sampling), with metadata  
logging and artifact tracking.

---

## 7. Learning Analytics Prototype for Simulation Tasks  
**Year:** 2024  
**Type:** Exploratory prototype  
**Domain:** Educational analytics  

Collects student interactions (editing patterns, runtime behavior, model  
adjustments) during simulation-based tasks to evaluate conceptual reasoning.

---

## 8. Microservice Observability Pack  
**Years:** 2019–2020  
**Type:** Engineering toolkit  
**Domain:** Platform reliability  

Includes logging patterns, trace propagation utilities, health-check modules,  
and baseline dashboards for ML microservices deployed in production.
