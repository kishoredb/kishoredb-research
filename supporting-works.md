# 🔧 Supporting Works  

These are the smaller building blocks and utilities that quietly keep larger platforms reliable and usable in real life.

**Author:** Kishore D. B.  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Updated:** 2025-12-02  

These supporting works represent practical engineering contributions, platform components,  
DevSecOps improvements, and applied analytics utilities that complement my major Selected Works.  
Each item reflects real-world, explainable, hands-on experience in cloud-native SaaS systems,  
AI-enabled risk workflows, and secure enterprise engineering.

---

## 1. AKS-Based Deployment Automation Framework  
**Years:** 2020–2023  
**Type:** Engineering Infrastructure  
**Domains:** Cloud deployments, Kubernetes, Azure DevOps  

Designed deployment automation templates for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), enabling  
repeatable, secure deployments through Helm charts, gated approvals, and environment-specific  
configuration separation for multi-tenant SaaS platforms.

---

## 2. CI/CD Governance Pipelines for Regulated SaaS  
**Years:** 2020–2023  
**Type:** DevSecOps Implementation  
**Domains:** CI/CD, compliance, pipeline security  

Implemented CI/CD pipelines with mandatory validation gates, security scanning (SAST/DAST),  
artifact signing, environment promotion checks, and automated audit trails to support  
regulatory alignment and platform governance.

---

## 3. Centralized Observability & Telemetry Layer  
**Years:** 2021–2023  
**Type:** Observability Engineering  
**Domains:** Monitoring, tracing, logging, FinOps  

Developed a unified observability layer combining distributed tracing, structured logs,  
custom application metrics, and cloud cost probes. Enabled root-cause tracing, real-time  
visibility, and optimization insights for SaaS workloads.

---

## 4. API Gateway Architecture for Multi-Product SaaS  
**Year:** 2022  
**Type:** Platform Architecture  
**Domains:** API design, security, routing  

Defined a centralized API gateway framework handling secure routing, throttling, RBAC,  
token validation, and lifecycle management across multiple business applications.  
Improved cross-product consistency and lowered integration complexity.

---

## 5. Document Classification Prototype (NLP)  
**Year:** 2021  
**Type:** Applied AI Prototype  
**Domains:** Document intelligence, NLP, automation  

Developed a prototype NLP model to classify incoming documents (applications, statements,  
supporting materials) for faster routing within credit and lending workflows.  
Helped reduce manual review time and improved consistency.

---

## 6. Rule-Augmented Risk Flagging Utility  
**Years:** 2020–2022  
**Type:** Analytics Component  
**Domains:** Credit risk, heuristics, explainable logic  

Created a rule-augmented scoring utility used as an initial risk pre-check before  
ML-based credit scoring. Combined heuristic thresholds with domain logic to produce  
fast, transparent risk flags.

---

## 7. Data Quality Validation Layer for Credit & Fraud Pipelines  
**Years:** 2021–2023  
**Type:** Data Engineering Component  
**Domains:** Data validation, pipeline reliability  

Built a reusable validation layer ensuring schema correctness, field completeness,  
temporal consistency, and feature-level sanity checks for analytics and credit/fraud  
modeling pipelines.

---

## 8. DevSecOps Maturity Model & Assessment Toolkit  
**Year:** 2023  
**Type:** Engineering Leadership Artifact  
**Domains:** DevSecOps, platform governance  

Created a maturity model and assessment toolkit for engineering teams adopting  
DevSecOps practices. Included evaluation rubrics, capability tiers, recommended practices,  
and roadmap templates for regulated cloud SaaS environments.

## Summary  
These supporting works strengthen my broader contributions across **cloud-native engineering**,  
**DevSecOps**, **applied AI utilities**, **risk/credit analytics**, and **SaaS platform design**.  
They complement the major Selected Works and demonstrate practical, hands-on depth  
in real-world enterprise systems.
