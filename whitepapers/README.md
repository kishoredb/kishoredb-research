# 📄 Whitepapers & Technical Documents

This folder is reserved for storing extended versions or PDF copies of whitepapers, architecture briefs, and technical reports referenced in the main repository.

At this time, all whitepapers are summarized and indexed in [`publications.md`](../publications.md), along with links to related deep-dive documents and technical projects.

As additional documents (PDFs, detailed write-ups, or published versions) become available, they will be added here for easier access and archival.

### What You Will Find Here (Future Additions)

- Full PDF versions of whitepapers  
- Extended architectural notes  
- Supporting technical diagrams  
- Supplementary materials referenced in publications  

For now, this folder acts as a placeholder for future uploads and organizes the repository structure cleanly.
