# 📄 Whitepapers & Architectural Documents

This folder is reserved for conceptual, architectural, and research-oriented whitepapers that complement the systems, deep-dives, and publications referenced in the main repository. These documents capture the strategic, design, and methodological thinking behind the platforms and analytics workflows I have developed.

At present, whitepapers are summarized and indexed in  
➡️ [`publications.md`](../publications.md)  
along with links to related deep-dive case studies and technical project documentation.

## 🔍 What These Whitepapers Represent

Each whitepaper typically provides:

- **System-level perspective** on design and architecture  
- **Data flow and pipeline insights** applicable to real-world deployments  
- **Patterns for reliability, trust, and explainability** in decision systems  
- **Domain-specific frameworks**, e.g., lending, fraud, healthcare, or cloud modernization  
- **Connections to deep-dive evaluations** and reproducibility artifacts  

These documents serve as high-level guidance for understanding the broader context and principles behind the engineering systems in this portfolio.

## 📚 Current Status

This folder currently acts as an **organized placeholder** for upcoming uploads such as:

- Full PDF versions of whitepapers  
- Extended architectural briefs  
- Supporting diagrams and supplementary visuals  
- Published reports and internal research documentation  

As PDFs and expanded documents become available, they will be archived here for easy access and citation.
